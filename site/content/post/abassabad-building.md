description: In the ancient times/in the old days, people used to find their way
  around by assigning specific guide pins to different areas (minarets). These
  pins, pictured below, were essentially mud houses with specific carvings or
  writings, intended to help people navigate their surroundings. now the
  question is that how can we redesign it more modern, multi-functional and with
  less material!
