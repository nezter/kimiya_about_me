    projectdescription: In the ancient times/in the old days, people used to find
      their way around by assigning specific guide pins to different areas
      (minarets). These pins, pictured below, were essentially mud houses with
      specific carvings or writings, intended to help people navigate their
      surroundings. now the question is that how can we redesign it more modern,
      multi-functional and with less material!
